Sum and Product
Lisa is hosting a party, during which she has planned for surprise gifts for her guests.

The guests while entering the hall should pick two slips of paper upon which numbers are written.

At the end of the party the guests should bring their slip of papers to Lisa. The Lucky ones are those who received numbers that satisfy the following condition.

The sum of the two numbers is the reverse of the product of the two numbers.

For example, If a guest has got X and Y as the two numbers, he will be a winner only if

X+ Y= AB; Then X * Y =BA.

Note : Both X and Y should be greater than 0. Otherwise print "Invalid Input"

Write a program to help Lisa find out the lucky winner. The program should accept two numbers, check the logic and display the message as shown in the sample output.
